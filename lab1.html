    <h1>Why Video Games are a thing we play.</h1>
        <p>Video games are one of several entertainment mediums, but one of a few that allows for entertainee input. Some view it as escapism, some view it as educational, and others view it as an artform. All are correct, video games are a unique medium in that it may display feats of amazing skill in art, direction, immersion, and thought. All of that while being something you can actively take part in, see and explore by yourself or with friends.</p>

        <p>That brings up another point, video games being a social exercise. While video games have been seen in the past, as well as times today, as an isolated and lonely hobby. That is not the case in this day in age. Well, at least not in the traditional sense. Gone are the days of playing a game for hours and hours by yourself in a single room. Sadly, somewhat gone as well is the era of couch based multiplayer. There are some games that still allow for the experience of playing with your friends in one room, but that is slowly being weeded out too. Where the social aspect lays today is in online multiplayer and in the rise of "Let's Play" videos found around the internet. In those ways video games have actually become both a social yet secluded form of entertainment.</p>
    
    <p>Just beware the signs of the illuminati. They're everywhere, oh god, they're here too. I can hear them at my door. Oh gods!</p>

    <p>In closing, <strike>I have delved too far into the rabbit hole and will update further when the need arises. Watch the skies people! Watch the skies!</strike>take care and good night.</p>
